# floatplane
just a little script that downloads the latest videos from floatplane club

I haven't worked on this in months, don't know if it still works. I just thought I would put it up in case it would be useful to someone. If anyone has a floatplane club subscription and would like to aid in development I'd appriciate it. I'd love to improve this code myself, but I don't have floatplane anymore.
